# Brief summary
this project consist of 1 main base class (Animal) that another class (Mammals) inherit from where Class (Mammals) has 5 child classes that inherit from it
those 5 classes are concret classes where the Mammal class has all the in common proberties and methods that all mammals has in common
the project defines some objects from those 5 classes and assign some values to them and call some overridden methods
the project also has unit testing for the Introduce method for each of the 5 concret classess

# Break down : 
inheirtenace: where a class obtains other class probs and methods and are able to use them freely in his own class

Polymorphism: Treating objects of different classes as if they belong to a common superclass, allowing flexible and interchangeable usage

Composition: Building objects by combining simpler objects or components, promoting code reuse and modularity

Abstraction: Simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential characteristics while hiding unnecessary details


# project def
i implemented the inheritance in my project where the Mammals class inheirt from the Animal class and the 5 concret classes inheirt from the Mammal class

i also implemented abstract class in the Animal and Mammal class where its the base class for other classes therefore its an abstract classes that i dont have to initialise
